## Troubleshoot OpenVPN ( initiation complete, cannot ping/scan)

Ref commands
Check iptables existing rules: sudo iptables -L

Allow TUN/TAP traffic: 
iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT

OR 
kill all open vpn process

>"The problem: I had multiple tun interfaces and that was causing instability.
The solution: <u>sudo killall openvpn</u> and then restart the OpenVPN client and it worked like a charm."

To remove interfaces left behind by improperly terminating openvpn, use <u>sudo ip link delete</u> to remove the interface.
